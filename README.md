# Introduction
At Cupertino High School, the FBLA advisor has always had a difficult time tracking service hours for each student in his  club of more than 100 students. As a teacher and an advisor, he has a lot of tasks throughout the day. Not only does he
need to create a lesson plan each day, he also needs to take care of FBLA issues, such as the tracking of Service Hours and Awards Program Category for each student. Without a doubt, he is exhausted by the end of the day.

Current software options are too complicated for the club to use effectively.

Enter Servicio, the first simple yet robust Awards Program management tool for
FBLA advisors everywhere. Say goodbye to technological
difficulties and overwhelmed advisors.

# Requirements
A windows or apple computer with java installed

# Software Used
I used JavaFX for the creation of the application and I used CSS to style the application. I also used sketch in order to get a rough design for the application.

# Sources
Since I already had extensive prior experience with javaFX, I did not use templates. Instead I referred to stack overflow or the JavaFX Documentation for assistance. 

Stack Overflow (stackoverflow.com)
Javafx Documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/toc.htm)

# Templates
No templates were used to develop Servicio.
